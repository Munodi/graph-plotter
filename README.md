#Graph-plotter

An html5 mathematical function plotter.  
It's in an early stage of development. I intend to use master as the main development branch and copy to the gh-pages as a release each time it's stable.

It currently works well on Firefox and Chrome (tested mostly in FF), but a few features don't work on IE and Safari.
